# palestinian-dresses-ontology

Maybe the first ontology for Palestinian dresses created with Protégé in RDF/OWL structure. 

In this project you'll find an OWL and an XML file with the ontology. If you want to open it to the Protégé programme you should use the OWL file. 

It contains as well a Power Point presentation of the project, both in pdf and pptx formats. 
In this presentation you'll find some SPARQL and DL queries that allows us to navigate easily in to the ontology and retrieve the information needed. 

Finally you'll find an Excel document with the organisation of our data before we integrate them manually in the ontology.
